/**
 * A superclass for scripting components with state-driven DOM manipulation.
 *
 * Note that, unlike reactive SPA libraries, this utility has no "render"
 * functionality. Instead, it assumes existing markup, and simply provides a way
 * to manipulate DOM dynamically according to the current value of some state.
 *
 * This utility does, however, borrow some techniques of SPA components, such as
 * reactive state. It also helps safely manage "props" by making the passed
 * `props` object a property of the component instance, then ensuring it's
 * immutable.
 *
 * @param {HTMLElement} element - The root-most HTML element (fragment) to which
 * the component script applies.
 * @param {object} props - Properties of the component instance (settings,
 * options, etc.), set at time of instantiation.
 *
 * @property {HTMLElement} element - The `element` argument provided as a
 * property of the component instance (`this`).
 * @property {object} props - The `props` argument provided as an immutable
 * property of the component instance (made immutable via a proxy setter).
 * @property {object} state - An mutable object for keeping track of the
 * component's state. Changes to this object are intercepted by a proxy, which
 * then emits a `state-change` event, triggering the component's local `sync`
 * method, which is responsible for updating the DOM. It batches and passes the
 * changed state data to the method for reference. Effectively, this keeps the
 * state and the DOM in "sync".
