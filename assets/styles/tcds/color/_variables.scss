/**
 * Color dictionary.
 *
 * The following color grades use the CIELUV color model for perceptual
 * uniformity, and were generated using the HSLuv tool. Using the primary red
 * brand color (#da2530) as the starting point, all reds have 11deg hue, and all
 * base colors (grade 300) have 47.6% lightness. Most colors have 87.7%
 * saturation, except for yellow and green due to having a broader saturation
 * range (normalized by eye).
 *
 * The following hues were used to generate the other colors:
 * blue = 250
 * yellow = 78.8
 * green = 135
 * gray = 265.9
 *
 * Tints and shades of each color were generated in increments of roughly
 * 10%-20%, and indexed on a scale of 0 to 500 in increments of 100:
 * 0 = 97.5% (~100%)
 * 100 = 90%
 * 200 = 70%
 * 300: 47.6% (~50%)
 * 400: 30%
 * 500: 10%
 *
 * Any two colors are accessible together if the difference between their grades
 * is 300 or greater.
