/**
 * Easing and timing variables for animations and transitions.
 *
 * "Productive" motion is fast and snappy, and is best used for productive user
 * tasks, or elements that only need subtle animation.
 *
 * "Expressive" motion is slower and smoother, and is best used to draw a user's
 * attention to a different portion of the screen from where they clicked or
 * where their focus may be.
 *
 * This map has a corresponding getter function, `animation` (see _functions).
