This mixin is only intended to be used to\n * address specific rendering quirks or known vendor bugs that cannot be\n * addressed any other way. It should not be used to build parallel stylesheets\n * for different browsers.\n *\n * Be warned that many of these browser-sniffing techniques are unstable, as\n * they typically test for the (lack of) support of certain features that may\n * end up becoming supported in the future. In this event, the queries should be\n * changed to include the version supported, e.g. from \"safari\" to \"lte safari\n * 15\" (less-than or equal-to Safari 15).\n *\n * If this happens, conditional styles should be reassessed. If a feature\n * becomes supported in a new version of a browser, detecting that browser at\n * all may no longer be necessary. If it is still necessary, a different browser\n * detection technique will need to be added under the original query.\n *\n * Also note that in most cases, browser targeting is done with the `@supports`\n * query, which is not supported in any version of IE, Edge < 12, Firefox <= 21,\n * Chrome <= 27, Safari <= 8, or iOS Safari <= 8.4. IE 11 is detected through\n * separate means.
