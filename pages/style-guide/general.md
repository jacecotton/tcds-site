## Editor
Download and use the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/jacecotton/tcds/blob/main/.editorconfig) file to take care of the below formatting rules automatically.

* Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Break comments at the 80 column limit.
* Use UTF-8 encoding.
* Insert new line at the end of every file.
* Trim trailing white space at the end of every line.

## Inline documentation
* Use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) comment documentation convention.
* Prefer concise and self-documenting code.
* Use explanatory comments only to convey the strategy or logical flow of a piece of code, or to explain unique idiosyncracies. Do not document syntax or native APIs.

## Code formatting
* Prefer double quotes (`"`) over single quotes (`'`).
  * Where permitted, use backticks (`` ` ``) instead of single quotes or escape characters (`\"`) to include double quotes within a string.
* Use empty lines (two returns) only for logical chunking of code, and only use a maximum of one empty line between lines of code.
