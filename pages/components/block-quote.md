    <p>
      Iâ€™m passionate about providing excellent orthopedic care to kids
      and teens. This means treating the whole child, not just treating
      a problem or injury, and getting to know each child and their
      family to create the best treatment plan.

## Best practices
**Ensure relevance and purpose.** Use blockquotes strategically to enhance the meaning or credibility of your content. Reserve blockquotes for significant points that add value, and avoid overusing them.

**Maintain contextual and factual integrity.** The quote must accurately reflect the author's intent. Verify your sources and never misattribute or misquote someone.

**Prioritize clarity and concision.** Block quotes are designed to grab attention; optimize the impact by getting to the point.

### When to use
**To showcase a valued participant's testimonial or personal statement.** Direct quotes from real people can help enhance the credibility of our services and reinforce key value propositions, boosting reader trust.

### When not to use
**To generally emphasize a block of text.** Block quotes are reserved strictly for quoting actual statements from someone, not merely to highlight arbitrary content.
