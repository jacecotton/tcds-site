## Goals
**Create pleasant, inclusive, and effective experiences.** Texas Children's websites should be intuitive to use and accessible to all, effective in connecting patients and visitors with the care and information they seek.

**Establish a single source-of-truth.** By providing a centralized library of reusable solutions to precedented challenges, we can reduce guesswork, inconsistency, and duplication during design, development, and maintenance.

**Reinforce the Texas Children's brand.** By adhering to and enforcing a consistent brand program, we can contribute to the cohesion and credibility of the Texas Children's brand on the web.
