## Best practices
**Avoid using icons by themselves.** Icons cannot be guaranteed to have universally well-understood meaning ([1](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/ "Icon Usability - Nielsen Norman Group")). Icons are best used as illustrative aids to *enhance* meaning (in addition to text), *not* to be the sole indicator of it.

**Ensure icons are meaningful and relevant.** An icon should, to the extent possible, independently and accurately reflect the sense of the accompanying text. Deduce the context-dependent [icon classification](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/classifying-icons/) (resemblance, symbolic, or conventional), and consider whether an icon of a different classification may be more effective.
