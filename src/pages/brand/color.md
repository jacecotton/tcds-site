## Palette
Texas Children's Design System provides a standardized, brand-compliant color palette. It uses a semantic naming system to help in the selection of colors that are thematically consistent and contextually meaningful.

### Primary palette
Our primary brand color is red, and in certain circumstances we utilize supporting shades (red 2 and 3) and tints (pink and pink 2).

<!--twig
<dl class="color-palette dl--semantic font-variant-tabular-nums">
  {% for color in colors.primary %}
    <div class="color-palette__item">
      <div class="color-palette__swatch" style="background: var(--tcds-color-{{ color.token|clean_id }})"></div>
      <dt>{{ color.token }}</dt>
      <dd>
        <b>{{ color.hex }}</b>
        <span>{{ color.cmyk }}</span>
      </dd>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}

**Use red for brand identity, icons, and accents.** For example, red is appropriate for logos, accent borders, buttons, and hyperlinks.

**Exercise restraint in your use of red.** Red is our primary brand colorâ€”it is used in our logo, and displayed prominently in many of our print and digital materials. Protect brand integrity by only using it to reinforce brand identity, *not* for generic or frivolous purposes.

**Do not use red as a background of a large section or multiple lines of text.** Red is a stark and striking color, which can visually overwhelm an experience if overused. Use pink for these purposes instead, which communicates the same identity.

**Do not use red text on the same line as differently colored text.** Text lockups can utilize different colors, but ensure red text is used on its own line. Hyperlinks in body content is an exception.

**Red 2 and 3 are strictly for state changes.** For example, red 2 is used when a [Button](/components/interface/button) is hovered over, while red 3 is used when clicked.

**Pink 2 is strictly for dark overlays on pink backgrounds.**
