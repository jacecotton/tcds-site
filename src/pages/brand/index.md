In this section, you can explore resources and documentation for six modules: [animation](/brand/animation), [color](/brand/color), [icons](/brand/icons), [logos](/brand/logos), [shape and shadow](/brand/shape-and-shadow), and [typography](/brand/typography).

This section is not intended for use as a general reference for our brand standards. Rather, our brand standards inform the development resources documented here.

## Key principles
The following principles help inform the Design System's implementation of our brand standards. Keep them in mind when utilizing the Design System on downstream projects.

**Consistency** reinforces brand integrity and trustworthiness. Recurring patterns and themes legitimize design decsisions, and complementary choices promote cohesion and familiarity.

**Accessibility** TBD...

**Simplicity**. The Texas Children's brand is not complex or busy. It makes limited use of gradients and shadows, with judicious use of borders and color contrast, and liberal use of white space. Rounded corners and circular frames convey the simple, welcoming approach to our aesthetic, inherited from our rounded logomark â€” <tcds-icon icon="texas-childrens" style="color: var(--tcds-color-primary)"></tcds-icon></li>

**Scalability** TBD...
