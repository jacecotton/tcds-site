## Guidance
### Best practices
**Strive for subtlety and meaningfulness.** Avoid unncessary, complex, or lengthy animations, which can detract from the user experience and credibility of our brand. Ensure animations are engaging and have some logical basis in the experience at hand.

**Use consistently.** Animation can impart a sense of dimensionality and cohesion if used consistently. If used in a disjointed manner, however, it can have the opposite effect.

**Use as an enhancement, not a requirement.** Before applying animation, ensure the design is effective and the content is accessible without it. Then, use it as a [progressive enhancement](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/ "Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It? — Smashing Magazine").

#### When to use
**Draw attention and direct focus.** Motion attracts the eye and can help overcome [change blindness](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/change-blindness-definition/ "Change Blindness in UX — Nielsen Norman Group") and [tunnel vision](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tunnel-vision-and-selective-attention/) in users. It can also help bolster engagement in experiences that are more visual rather than task-oriented or content-rich, like on landing pages.

**Establish and convey relationships.** Animation can hint towards and reinforce cause-and-effect relationships between elements and events.

**Provide rich visual feedback.** Animation can help make interactions more engaging and informative by responding to user behavior with reaffirming visual cues.

#### When not to use
**User has indicated reduced motion preference.** Respect user preferences by disabling animations or providing alternatives with reduced activity. See [&sect; Accessibility](#accessibility).

**Lack of contextual meaning or clear purpose.** Do not use animation for the sake of it; rather, use it to meaningfully improve the user experience.
