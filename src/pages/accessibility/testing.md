* Try to test with [the most popular assistive user agents](https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey10/#primary), such as JAWS and NVDA. Do not rely solely on testing with system software, such as Apple's VoiceOver, which [tends to have higher compliance with accessibility protocols](https://www.powermapper.com/tests/screen-readers/aria/) but lower market share, and thus is a less accurate representation of the typical user experience.
