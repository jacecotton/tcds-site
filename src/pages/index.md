## This site is under construction
Texas Children's Design System is a <b>work in progress</b>. Please check back for updates.

In the meantime, check out our progress and feel free to leave feedback on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/jacecotton/tcds/issues) or send it directly to [jxcotton@texaschildrens.org](mailto:jxcotton@texaschildrens.org).

## What this Design System is
TBD...

## What this Design System is not
**A general brand guideline.** It merely reflects and implements our brand guideline. It is the source of truth for Texas Children's design *on the web*, but is downstream from the organization's broader design authority. While feedback of all kinds is welcome, many aspects are beyond the remit of the web team.

**A general purpose library or framework.** While designed to be adaptable, it is also intended to enforce a relatively strict set of design, technical, and architectural decisions highly specific to the needs of Texas Children's and its online users.
