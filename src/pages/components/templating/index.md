Examples:
* Main content area (or main content area with sidebar)
* Section
  * Masthead (variant of section) - keep in mind we're still creating unique documentation pages and separate site studio components even if they're just variants of other components if it makes sense from an *authoring* perspective to consider them substantively different or intricately composed.
    * Profile coverflows (variant of masthead?) -->
