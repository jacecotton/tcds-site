/**
 * This file serves as the entrypoint for importing (via `@use`) all the index
 * files of each folder. Note that the actual file names imported here are
 * omitted, as if they are not specified, they default to _index.scss. So
 * `@forward "base"` will automatically import base/_index.scss.
 *
 * Index files only forward abstracts (variables, mixins, and functions). By
 * importing this file, all available abstracts from each folder are forwarded
 * and ready to be used. This file does not import any actual CSS rules. That is
 * the responsibility of tcds.scss.
 *
 * To use this file in individual stylesheets inside of subfolders, you do not
 * need to specify the file name. Simply use:
 *   @use "../" as *;
 *
 * Or, if you wish to namespace everything to avoid collisions:
 *   @use "../" as tcds;
 *
 * Within the TCDS codebase, however, this is not necessary.
