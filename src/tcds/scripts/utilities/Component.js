/**
 * A superclass for scripting components with state-driven DOM manipulation.
 *
 * Note that this utility has no "render" functionality. Rather, it assumes pre-
 * existing markup, and simply provides a way to manipulate DOM dynamically
 * according to the current value of some state.
 *
 * @param {HTMLElement} element - The root-most HTML element to which the
 * component script applies.
 * @param {object} props - Static properties of the component instance.
 *
 * @property {object} state - An object for keeping track of the component's
 * state. Changes to this object are intercepted by a proxy, which then emits a
 * `state-change` event, triggering the component's local `sync` method, which
 * is responsible for updating the DOM, while batching and passing the changed
 * state data to the method for reference (thereby keeping the state and the
 * DOM in "sync").
 * @property {object} props - An object for referencing static properties passed
 * to the component at time of instantiation.
