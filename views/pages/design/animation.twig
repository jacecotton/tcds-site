<h2 id="reduced-motion-preference">Reduced motion preference</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reduced motion does not mean no motion. Don&#39;t outright disable all animations when this preference is set. Rather, provide alternative animations that reduce the intensity, distance, and speed of an animation.</li>
<li>Do not autoplay animations (or videos) when this preference is set.</li>
</ul>
