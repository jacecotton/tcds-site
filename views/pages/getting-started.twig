<p>The fastest and easiest way to get started is to <a href="#linking-from-cdn">link CSS and JavaScript files from a CDN</a>. Then, you can copy and paste example HTML code, modifying it per your requirements.</p>
<p>However, this method is extremely limited. This only gives you access to <em>compiled</em> code, and requires that you manually copy and paste HTML, which is not very maintainable.</p>
<p>The recommended way to use the Design System is to download the uncompiled assets, and use them as a part of the build process of your project. This gives you access to variables, functions, mixins, and templates. You can do this via a <a href="#npm">package manager</a> or downloading and manually including the files from the <a href="#download-archive">downloads</a>.</p>

<p>You can load the Design System straight from a CDN via UNPKG, powered by Cloudflare:</p>
