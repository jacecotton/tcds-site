<p>The fastest and easiest way to get started is to <a href="#linking-from-cdn">link CSS and JavaScript files from a CDN</a>. Then, you can copy and paste example HTML code, modifying it per your requirements.</p>
<p>However, this method is extremely limited. This only gives you access to <em>compiled</em> code, and requires that you manually copy and paste HTML, which is not very maintainable.</p>
<p>The recommended way to use the Design System is to download the uncompiled assets, and use them as a part of the build process of your project. This gives you access to variables, functions, mixins, and templates. See <a href="#project-setup">&sect; Project setup</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linking-from-cdn">Linking from CDN</h2>
<p>You can load the Design System straight from a CDN via UNPKG, powered by Cloudflare:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;head&gt;
  ...
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://unpkg.com/@tch/tcds/tcds.min.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  ...
  &lt;script async src=&quot;https://unpkg.com/@tch/tcds/tcds.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>
