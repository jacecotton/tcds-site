<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p><strong>Create pleasant, inclusive, and effective experiences.</strong> Texas Children&#39;s websites should be intuitive to use and accessible to all, effective in connecting patients and visitors with the care and information they seek.</p>
<p><strong>Establish a single source-of-truth.</strong> By providing a centralized library of reusable solutions to precedented challenges, we can reduce guesswork, inconsistency, and duplication during design, development, and maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Reinforce the Texas Children&#39;s brand.</strong> By adhering to and enforcing a consistent brand program, we can contribute to the cohesion and credibility of the Texas Children&#39;s brand on the web.</p>
