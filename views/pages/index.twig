<p>Goals are accomplished by following our <a href="#principles">Principles</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Create pleasant and inclusive experiences.</strong> Our web products should be intuitive to use and accessible to all, with a strong sense of cohesion and credibility.</p>
<p><strong>Increase efficiency and focus.</strong> By documenting and demonstrating established solutions to precedented challenges, we reduce guesswork and redundancies, and streamline the process of prototyping, iterating, and maintaining on the web.</p>

<!-- 
**Human-centered design.**

* Intuitive: Experiences should be familiar and consistent to maximize user engagement and [limit cognitive load](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/ "Minimize Cognitive Load to Maximize Usability â€” Nielsen Norman Group") from inconsistent or esoteric design.
* Focused: Experiences should be as simple and streamlined as possible to achieve the required user goal. Design patterns should consider the target audience, define optimal use cases, and when they should not be used.
* Inclusive: Going a step beyond [accessibility](/accessibility), inclusive design is a committment to bringing efficient and pleasant experiences to users of all abilities and backgrounds.
* Performant: Views should be fast to load, and interaction should feel smooth and efficient. Requests transfer minimal data to users, and leverage the most efficient rendering strategies for the task at hand.

**Standardized.**

* Modern: Newly stable technologies and APIs are leveraged to provide users with the most performant, effective, and feature-rich interfaces possible.
* Consistent: Everything from interaction design, pattern design, coding style, API integration, to aesthetic style should be consistent with a single source of truth.
* Semantic: Content and interface elements are enriched with semantic meaning, enhancing the accessibility of assistive technology, integration with social media, and understanding by search engine algorithms.
* Adaptable: Every element is made with iteration and logistics for updating and maintaining in mind.
