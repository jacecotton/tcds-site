<h2 id="what-this-design-system-is-not">What this Design System is not</h2>
<p><strong>A general brand guideline.</strong> It merely reflects and implements our brand guideline. It is the source of truth for Texas Children&#39;s design <em>on the web</em>, but is downstream from the organization&#39;s broader design authority. While feedback of all kinds is welcome, many aspects are beyond the remit of the web team.</p>
<p><strong>A general purpose library or framework.</strong> While designed to be adaptable, it is also intended to enforce a relatively strict set of design, technical, and architectural decisions highly specific to the needs of Texas Children&#39;s and its online users.</p>
