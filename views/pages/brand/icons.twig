<p><strong>Avoid using icons by themselves.</strong> Icons cannot be guaranteed to have universally well-understood meaning (<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/icon-usability/" title="Icon Usability - Nielsen Norman Group">1</a>). Icons are best used as illustrative aids to <em>enhance</em> meaning (in addition to text), <em>not</em> to be the sole indicator of it.</p>
<p><strong>Ensure icons are meaningful and relevant.</strong> An icon should, to the extent possible, independently and accurately reflect the sense of the accompanying text. Deduce the context-dependent <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/classifying-icons/">icon classification</a> (resemblance, symbolic, or conventional), and consider whether an icon of a different classification may be more effective.</p>
