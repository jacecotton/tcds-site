<p>WORK IN PROGRESS</p>
<ul>
<li>in general go over responsive design guidance — maybe rename this page to responsive design? other pages are related to responsiveness (grid, size, etc.)<ul>
<li>OR, create a layout overview page, go over responsive design there, covering info regarding breakpoints, grid, size, etc.</li>
<li>responsive approach — mobile-first, progressive enhancement, experience parity</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>these breakpoints are just a starting point and a good way to coordinate broad changes between multiple different elements in a template or page — but we encourage the use of custom breakpoints that adapt to the specific needs of the component or other element being designed</li>
<li>breakpoints only roughly correspond to general device type — exact device targeting is discouraged</li>
<li>&quot;in the future&quot; section<ul>
<li>custom media queries will get replaced with style queries</li>
<li>window-based breakpoints will get phased out in favor of container queries</li>
</ul>
</li>
