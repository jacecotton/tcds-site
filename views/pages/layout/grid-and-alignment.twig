<h2 id="positioning">Positioning</h2>
<p>In web layout nomenclature, <strong>positioning</strong> has to do with the <em>alignment</em> and <em>justification</em> of an element.</p>
<p>The <strong>alignment</strong> of an element is its position along the <em>cross axis</em> (vertical direction in default flow and top-to-bottom languages).</p>
<p>The <strong>justification</strong> of an element is its position along the <em>main axis</em> (horizontal direction in default flow and top-to-bottom languages).</p>
<h3 id="floating">Floating</h3>
<p>Floating is neither positioning nor alignment, but rather describes how surrounding content should flow around an element.</p>
