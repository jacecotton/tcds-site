<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<p><strong>Avoid overloading cards with content.</strong> Cards are meant to display snippets and serve as teasers, not as layout containers for full content. If even the teaser content is lengthy, consider rewriting it to be shorter. Avoid truncating content with ellipses.</p>
<p><strong>Choose the right variant for the context.</strong> For example, if default cards clutter an interface, consider a <a href="#lite-variant">lite card</a>; to optimize vertical space, consider a <a href="#orientation">horizontal card</a>; if using cards to enumerate more than a few subtopics, consider <a href="#icon-variant">icon cards</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use heading elements for card titles if appropriate.</strong> If cards help to outline a page&#39;s overall content, use the semantically appropriate heading element. The component stylesheet will ensure the title&#39;s style remains consistent no matter the element used.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<h4 id="orientation">Orientation</h4>
<p>Cards have two available orientations: vertical (image above content) and horizontal (image left of content).</p>
<ul>
<li>By default, cards are vertical. On small screens, cards become horizontal, but will switch back to vertical if the card&#39;s container (such as a sidebar or carousel slide) is too small.</li>
<li>Cards try to fill the full width of their containers, though vertical cards have a maximum width of 640px. Vertical cards also have a larger padding above 325px.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can lock a card&#39;s orientation by setting the <a href="#orientation-attribute"><code>orientation</code> attribute</a> to either <code>vertical</code> or <code>horizontal</code>.</p>

<h4 id="lite-variant">Lite variant</h4>
<p>The lite variant provides a simplified card design. It can help reduce visual noise if needed, and may work better on darker backgrounds. In HTML, you can use it by adding <code>lite</code> to the <a href="#variant-attribute"><code>variant</code> attribute</a>.</p>

<h4 id="centered-variant">Centered variant</h4>
<p>The centered variant works best for cards with more sparse content, such as those used for enumerating services, subtopics, etc. rather than longer content snippets. In HTML, you can use it by adding <code>centered</code> to the <code>variant</code> attribute.</p>
<p>This variant is not available for horizontal cards.</p>

<h4 id="custom-footer">Custom footer</h4>
<p>By default, a card&#39;s footer has a &quot;Learn more&quot; call-to-action (CTA) label. In HTML, the label can be changed by setting the <a href="#cta-attribute"><code>cta</code> attribute</a>. You can omit the CTA label by setting the attribute to an empty string.</p>

<p>You can also insert arbitrary content, such as multiple links, into the footer. In HTML, you can do this with the <a href="#footer-slot"><code>footer</code> slot</a> (which will override the <code>cta</code> attribute).</p>

<p>VARIANTS:</p>
<ul>
<li>CTA: Center title, no description slot, no footer slot, &quot;Learn more&quot; secondary button auto-add. Responsively, image goes to left, title left-justified, &quot;Learn more&quot; button disappears but arrow stays. CURRENTLY CALLED: Business Entity Landing Page variant</li>
<li>Profile: Image is circled, 1/3 width of the card, centered, and straddled over the top; title is sans-serif bold and centered, also smaller; &quot;View profile&quot; secondary link is auto-added, centered. Description slot optional; length should be no more than a single line, text is centered.<ul>
<li>+lite: like the profile &quot;cards&quot; used for the Taylor Lab and Data Science Hub</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spotlight: content area is translucent navy background, overlaid at the bottom of the image area which expands to the full dimensions of the card; on mobile, content area is put beneath the image and is made solid navy</li>
<li>Icon card: default CTA becomes primary button</li>
</ul>
<p>SPECS:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the link is an external link, instead of a secondary button, there is an &quot;[external icon] [hostname of external website]&quot; badge added to the footer to indicate an external jump.</li>
<li>Should work well with quick links added to footer (as in location map card).<ul>
<li>In horizontal cards, quick links should be beneath both the image and text, spanning the full width of the card.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meta slot for dates</li>
<li>Tags in top right corner of image area (placed over angled gradient) for classifications</li>
<li>Eyebrow inside of heading element (like &quot;Texas Children&#39;s&quot; in location cards)<ul>
<li>This is done by adding a span inside a heading element. Note that heading elements are not required. To add them, put the <code>slot=&quot;title&quot;</code> on a heading element, and the <code>a</code> element inside the heading element.<ul>
<li>Styling should look for whatever has <code>slot=title</code>, and handle the link surfacing and de-visualization of the link irrespective of whether a heading is used in combination.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
