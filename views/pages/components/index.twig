<p>Each documentation page in this section is broken up into &quot;Guidance&quot; and &quot;Documentation&quot; sections.</p>
<p>Guidance sections include best practices, when and when not to use, how to use components (with examples), and compliance issues to keep in mind when using components.</p>
<p>Documentation sections include technical information, such as engineering and compliance decisions taken in the creation of components, and API tables for exactly how components work under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
