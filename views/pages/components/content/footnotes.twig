  Today, TB remains the leading infectious cause of death globally.
  Each year, 10.6 million people develop TB. Of this group, 1.3 million
  people on average die annually. Furthermore,
  <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="who pediatrics">about 1 million children develop TB
  and 225,000 die on average each year – that’s one child every four
  seconds.</tcds-fn-ref> Of the children who die from TB,
  <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="pediatrics">96% were never diagnosed or
  had the opportunity to receive treatment.</tcds-fn-ref>
</p>

<p>
  Not everyone who is infected with TB develops the disease, though.
  <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="emerg-infect-dis">Approximately 25% of
  the world’s population have at some time in their lives been infected
  with TB,</tcds-fn-ref> but they don’t develop the disease or present
  outward symptoms. People with latent, asymptomatic TB can, however,
  spread the bacteria to others.

<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<p><strong>Use footnotes sparingly.</strong> Too many footnotes may interfere with reading and distract users.</p>
<p><strong>Stick to citations and disclaimers, avoid asides and parentheticals.</strong>  Footnotes are best for content that is obligatory to mention, but strictly optional to read. Due to the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/interaction-cost-definition/">interaction cost</a> associated with footnotes (clicking, jumping, extra reading, and then scrolling back), asides and explanatory notes are best either worked into the main prose, presented in a <a href="/components/content/callout">Callout</a>, or omitted.</p>
<p><strong>Place footnote references outside of all punctuation.</strong> You can ensure this by placing the closing reference tag in HTML after punctuation (see <a href="#usage">&sect; Usage</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Footnotes must be referenced in related content.</strong> Footnotes do not stand on their own; they are directly connected to sentences or sentence fragments via references.</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>In HTML, footnotes themselves are marked up as <code>li</code> elements inside an ordered list (<code>ol</code>) placed inside a <code>tcds-fn-list</code> element. Each <code>li</code> should have a unique <code>id</code>.</p>
<p>Footnote references are added to copy by wrapping the relevant text in <code>tcds-fn-ref</code> tags, which should then have an <code>aria-details</code> attribute set to the <code>id</code> of the associated footnote <code>li</code>.</p>

{% embed "@tc/includes/example.twig" %}
{% block content %}
<p>
  <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="example">This is a sentence which has a
  footnote associated with it.</tcds-fn-ref>
</p>

<tcds-fn-list>
  <ol>
    <li id="example">This is a footnote associated with the above sentence.</li>
  </ol>
</tcds-fn-list>
{% endblock %}
{% endembed %}


<p>The <code>tcds-fn-ref</code> and <code>ol</code> elements keep track of the numbering for you, in order to avoid manual re-indexing in the event a footnote is added, removed, or rearranged.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-references-per-footnote">Multiple references per footnote</h4>
<p>You may reference the same footnote multiple times by using the same <code>aria-details</code> attribute across each <code>tcds-fn-ref</code> instance.</p>

{% embed "@tc/includes/example.twig" %}
{% block content %}
<p>
  <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="multi-example">This is a sentence which
  has a footnote associated with it.</tcds-fn-ref> And <tcds-fn-ref
  aria-details="another">this is a sentence with another
  footnote.</tcds-fn-ref> And now <tcds-fn-ref aria-details="multi-example">
  this is another with a reference to the same footnote as the first.</tcds-fn-ref>
</p>

<tcds-fn-list>
  <ol>
    <li id="multi-example">
      This is a footnote associated with the first and third above sentences.
    </li>
    <li id="another">
      This is a footnote associated with the second sentence.
    </li>
  </ol>
</tcds-fn-list>
{% endblock %}
{% endembed %}


<p>The return link inside the footnote (↵) will always link back to the first reference only.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>Each reference has an <code>aria-details</code> attribute pointing to an <code>li</code> inside an ordered list. Without JavaScript, there will be no superscript numbered jump link, but the footnote itself will still be accessible inside the <code>ol</code>, and screen reader software will announce when a piece of text is &quot;further detailed&quot; by that footnote.</p>
<p>When the custom elements are upgraded via JavaScript, the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>An <code>id</code> is added to the <code>tcds-fn-ref</code> element, generated from the <code>id</code> of the associated <code>li</code> and appended with <code>-ref</code>. This allows the reference to be linked back to from the footnote.</li>
<li>An anchor (<code>a</code>) element is added to create a jump link to the reference, with an ARIA <code>role</code> of <code>doc-noteref</code> and a visually hidden text fragment indicating to screen readers that it is a footnote.</li>
<li>In the <code>tcds-fn-list</code>, an <code>aside</code> sectioning element is generated with an ARIA <code>role</code> of <code>doc-endnotes</code> and labeled by a visually hidden heading element. The heading level of this element is determined by incrementing from the immediately previous heading level to preserve a logical and valid content outline.</li>
<li>Inside each footnote <code>li</code>, a link is appended to jump back to the reference to allow users to easily return to the main content. This link (↵) has an ARIA <code>role</code> of <code>doc-backlink</code> and an <code>aria-label</code> of <code>&quot;Return to associated passage&quot;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="known-issues">Known issues</h3>
<details>
  <summary>To-do</summary>

<ul>
<li>It should be possible to associate multiple references with a single sentence or clause, e.g.<sup>1, 2</sup> This should be made possible in the event <code>aria-details</code> contains a space-separated list of idents.</li>
<li>Explore the possibility of pinpoint citations (perhaps a <code>pincite</code> attribute), appended to the reference number and separated by a colon.</li>
<li>Further testing with screen readers must be done, particularly with respect to the use of <code>aria-details</code> to associate references with footnotes (<a href="https://a11ysupport.io/tech/aria/aria-details_attribute">latest available public data for user agent implementation</a> is 2 years old, see <a href="https://a11ysupport.io/tests/tech__aria__aria-details">tests</a>).</details></li>
