<blockquote>
<p>One of the main upsides observed with home page carousels is that they are an easy way to include large and bespoke imagery. We saw during testing that large and custom images on the home page give users a good first impression of the website â€” increasing the time spent after landing on a new website, before they make their initial snap judgement of whether to stay or leave. In other words, we see that large bespoke imagery often reduces home page bounce rates while also reflecting positively on the website and brand.</p>
