<h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>
<p><strong>Write section labels in sentence case.</strong> All-uppercase text is slower and more difficult to read (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/low-vision-needs/#capitalization">1</a>). Furthermore, screen readers sometimes interpret certain uppercased words as common initialisms (such as ADD or US), and may erroneously spell out those words letter by letter (<a href="https://webaim.org/techniques/screenreader/#:~:text=Screen%20readers%20try%20to%20pronounce%20acronyms%2C%20if%20there%20are%20sufficient%20vowels/consonants%20to%20be%20pronounceable.%20Otherwise%2C%20they%20spell%20out%20the%20letters.">2</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Do not use the word &quot;accordion&quot; to refer end users to contained content.</strong> The term &quot;accordion&quot; is a common web design convention, but is not part of the common English vernacular. To direct users to content inside an accordion, use more generic descriptors, like &quot;collapsible sections&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="when-to-use">When to use</h3>
<p><strong>Progressive disclosure.</strong> In cases where only certain sections of content might be relevant to given audience segments, despite all sections being relevant to the topic of a page (e.g. a &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; page), it is helpful to present a user with a choice before revealing content.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation assistance.</strong> Sometimes, a page may become too long to be comfortably navigated. If it cannot be simplified or split into multiple pages, an accordion can help condense content to make it less cumbersome to navigate.</p>
<h3 id="when-not-to-use">When not to use</h3>
<p><strong>Low engagement or low discoverability.</strong> If there is evidence to suggest users cannot or are not accessing the content they&#39;re looking for, show it by default.</p>
<p><strong>A different component better fits the use case.</strong> For quickly comparing different pieces of content of the same information type, consider the <a href="/components/tabs">tabs component</a>. For collapsing only a single, independent section, consider <a href="/components/details">details</a>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="allow-multiple-sections">Allow multiple sections</h3>
<p>To allow multiple sections to be opened at one time, add the <a href="#multiple-attribute"><code>multiple</code> attribute</a>.</p>
